# We want email
# we will validate if user is already in our database we will not create any user and ask user to log in please 
# we will generate a otp 4 digit
# we will send original otp to users mail
# we will hash that 4 digit otp
# we will generate an token with the current date + hashed otp + email send it back
# in frontend we will store it to users local storage

# when user enter otp we will send otp + JWT token back to backend
# we will check about its time validation
# we will extract the hashed otp and email from jwt token
# We will create a hash for recieven otp 
# We will verify the recieved otp 
# If verified then we will create a user who is not activated but authenticated
